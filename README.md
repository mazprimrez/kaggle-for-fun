A collection of Kaggle projects!

1. **Ecommerce Sales Forecast** <br>
   A daily sales forecast using Prophet model. Eight versions are experimented and the model revealed that 74.06 RMSE is the best result in the experiments. The gap analysis is also conducted and shows that there was a sudden drop in the test dataset that didn't happen in train dataset. Such, the RMSE score can be lower if we knew the reason of the sales drop.
2. **Fraud Detection** <br>
   The dataset is sampled to 5% of total dataset. The result shows 99.7% for Recall and Precision Score. The impact of this model is also analyzed.
